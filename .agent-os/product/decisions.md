## 2025-01-17: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Develop a modern, SEO-optimized corporate website for DeepIQ to replace the existing deepiq.com, targeting oil and gas industry professionals with compelling case studies, clear value propositions, and streamlined lead capture mechanisms.

### Context

The current DeepIQ website needs modernization to better serve prospective customers from the oil and gas industry. The new website must effectively showcase case studies, improve lead generation, and establish DeepIQ as a thought leader in AI-powered solutions for the energy sector. Inspiration is drawn from successful B2B SaaS sites like Corva.ai.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **WordPress with Custom Theme**
   - Pros: Quick to deploy, extensive plugin ecosystem, familiar CMS
   - Cons: Performance limitations, security concerns, less flexibility for custom features

2. **Static Site Generator (Gatsby/Hugo)**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, strong SEO, simple hosting
   - Cons: Limited dynamic functionality, complex for non-technical content editors

3. **React SPA with Client-side Rendering**
   - Pros: Rich interactivity, modern development experience
   - Cons: Poor SEO without SSR, slower initial load, complexity

### Rationale

Next.js was selected for its superior SEO capabilities through SSR/SSG, excellent developer experience with TypeScript, strong performance optimization features, and proven scalability for enterprise websites. The framework's built-in optimizations and Vercel's hosting platform provide an ideal combination for a high-performance marketing website.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Improved search engine rankings through SSR and optimized Core Web Vitals
- Faster development with modern tooling and component-based architecture
- Better lead conversion through optimized performance and UX
- Scalable foundation for future features and integrations

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development complexity compared to traditional CMS
- Requires JavaScript/React expertise for maintenance
- Potential learning curve for content editors without Contentful experience

## 2025-01-17: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel hosting as the core technology stack, supplemented by Supabase for data, Contentful for CMS, and HubSpot for CRM integration.

### Context

The technology stack must balance modern best practices with practical considerations for SEO, performance, and maintainability. The selection prioritizes developer productivity, scalability, and optimal user experience for B2B lead generation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **MEAN/MERN Stack**
   - Pros: Full JavaScript stack, flexible architecture
   - Cons: Requires more configuration, separate SEO implementation needed

2. **JAMstack with Netlify CMS**
   - Pros: Simple deployment, built-in CMS
   - Cons: Limited CMS features, less flexibility for dynamic content

### Rationale

The chosen stack provides the best balance of SEO optimization, developer experience, and scalability. Vercel's infrastructure is optimized for Next.js, Tailwind CSS accelerates UI development, and the integration options support enterprise requirements.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal SEO and performance out of the box
- Rapid development with pre-configured tooling
- Seamless deployment and preview workflows
- Strong ecosystem and community support

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in with Vercel for optimal performance
- Ongoing costs for Contentful and third-party services
- Complexity in managing multiple service integrations
