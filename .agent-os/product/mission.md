## The Problem

### Disconnected Operations & Missed Opportunities

Oil and gas companies lose millions annually due to unplanned downtime and inefficient operations. Industry reports show that operators experience 27 days of NPT per year on average, costing $30-50 million per rig annually.

**Our Solution:** DeepIQ provides AI-powered predictive analytics that reduce NPT by up to 30% through early detection and prevention.

### Data Silos Preventing Insights

Despite collecting terabytes of operational data, most companies struggle to derive actionable insights. Studies indicate that only 1% of oil and gas data is being utilized effectively.

**Our Solution:** DeepIQ's platform integrates disparate data sources and applies advanced AI to unlock hidden patterns and optimization opportunities.

### Slow Adoption of Digital Technologies

The oil and gas industry lags behind other sectors in digital adoption, with only 30% of companies having comprehensive digital strategies.

**Our Solution:** DeepIQ offers proven, industry-specific AI solutions with demonstrated ROI, making digital transformation accessible and measurable.
