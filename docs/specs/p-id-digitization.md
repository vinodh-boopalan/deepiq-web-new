# P&ID Digitization Solution Specification

## Overview

The P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram) Digitization solution is an AI-powered platform that automatically extracts, interprets, and digitizes complex engineering drawings. Using advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, this solution transforms static P&ID documents into intelligent, searchable, and actionable digital assets, revolutionizing how industrial organizations manage their engineering documentation.

## Problem Statement

P&IDs are critical engineering documents that contain vital information about industrial processes, equipment, and safety systems. However, most organizations face significant challenges:
